This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) eNotebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

1. Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button (little green sideways triangle in the top corner of the gray chunk) within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r plot}
plot(cars)
```

2. Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* (small green C button above, select 'R' as the language) button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I* if you are using a PC [fill in other keyboard shortcuts here]. 

```{r}
head(cars)
```


3. Now we're going to inspect the 'cars' dateframe that you plotted above. Use the 'head()' function to look at a sample of the 'cars' dataframe. Remember to run your code chunk to see the output!

4. Run the code chunk below to see what the maximum speed in the dataframe is! 

```{r}
max(cars$speed)
```

5. The max() function has an opposite - the min() function! Complete the code chunk below by typing in the parenthesis to discover the minimum speed in the dataframe!

```{r}
min(cars$speed)
```

6. What is the minimum speed? Respond in the quiz question in Coursera.


When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
