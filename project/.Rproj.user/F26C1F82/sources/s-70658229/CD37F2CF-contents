## Background for this activity
[WRITER TO CONSTRUCT]
- This should be the same set of sentences before every activity most likely
- This can be in the text of the Coursera item (before learners click on the link)

## The Scenario

[WRITER TO CONSTRUCT]
- You work at a large grocery company with many different brands
- You want to share some visuals at a presentation on supermarket trends

## Step 1: Import your data

[WRITER TO EDIT]

Run the code below to read in the file 'supermarket_sales.csv' into a dataframe that you will use for your visualization. 

Note, we will name the dataframe 'supermarket_sales' to be clear on what the data is. 

If you experience errors, remember that you can search the internet and the RStudio community for help:

[Note for GwG team: we'll need to follow the same process we did for other Kaggle datasets to make sure we have permission]

Learn more about the dataset here:
https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales?select=supermarket_sales+-+Sheet1.csv

```{r load data}
supermarket_sales <- read.csv("supermarket_sales.csv")
```

## Step 2: Look at a sample of your data

Use the head() function to look at your data (remember you can click on the arrows in the header row to look at more columns)

```{r examining your data}
head(supermarket_sales)
```
Remember - you can also use colnames() to look at the name of all the columns in your data set. Run the code chunk below to see the column names in this datset.

```{r look at column names}
colnames(supermarket_sales)
```

[WRITER TO EDIT -> OPPORTUNITY FOR A QUIZ QUESTION]
Question: How many columns are there in this dataset? 
Answer: 17 (run the code in line 47)

Question: There is a column named 'Profit' in this dataset. True or False?
Answer: False (run the code in line 52)

## Step 3: Install and load the 'ggplot2' package
Remember, if you haven't already installed and loaded the 'ggplot2' package, you'll need to do that before you can use the ggplot() function. You only have to do this once though, not every time you call ggplot().

Run the code chunk below to install and load 'ggplot2' - this may take a few minutes!

```{r loading and installing ggplot2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
install.packages('ggplot2')
library(ggplot2)
```

## Step 4: Begin creating a plot
[WRITER TO EDIT]
Let's say a stakeholder says to you "I want to increase the total amount that someone is spending at our stores, and I think that if a person buys a higher quantity of items, then they'll always be spending proportionally more money." 

You want to create a visualization to see how true that statement is or isn't.

Great! We can use ggplot to do this. Try running the code below.

```{r creating a plot}
ggplot(data = supermarket_sales) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Quantity, y = Total))
```
## Step 5: Remembering a common error
[WRITER TO EDIT]
A common error that R users sometimes encounter is if they put their + sign at the beginning of the next line instead of the end of the previous line. For example, try running the code chunk below to see what happens

```{r common error}
ggplot(data = supermarket_sales) 
 + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Quantity, y = Total))
```

## Step 6: Try it on your own
[WRITER TO EDIT]
Try mapping 'Tax' and 'Total' on the x and y axes respectively by filling out the remainder of the code below.
```{r}
ggplot(data = supermarket_sales) +
 geom_point(mapping = aes(x = , y = ))
```
